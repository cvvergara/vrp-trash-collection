# Vehicle Routing Problems - Documentation

The project is developing C++ classes for solving Vehicle Routing Problems
(VRP). We are developing a collection of base classes to support
building solvers for specific VRP problems. And we are creating solutions for
specific problems using our base classes.

Longer term we plan to also wrap our solvers into the 
[pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org/) project.
