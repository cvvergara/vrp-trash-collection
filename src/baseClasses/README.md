 * tweval.h - extends Twnode and adds auto evaluation book keeping
 * twnode.h - extends Node and adds capacity and time windows
 * node.h - provides a basic Node class
 * twc.h - provides tools for evaluating time window compatibility
 * plot.h - a simple class to support generating images of nodes and paths
 * md5.h - provides tools to generate an md5 hash from a string or file
