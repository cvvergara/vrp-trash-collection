## Vehicle Routing Problem - Pickup and Delivery with Time Windows


*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*
*This means that the code does not work or does not work well.*


This code is my attempt to implement the algorithm in:

"Solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using reactive tabu search" by William P. Nanry and J. Wesley Barnes 1999

I have also incorporated ideas from other papers such as:

"Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows, Algorithm abd Test Case Generation" by Hoong Chuin Lau and Z. Liang, 2002

"Constructing initial solutions for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows" by Manar Hosney and Christine Mumford, 2011

The plan for this code once it is working will be to integrate it into the pgRouting project.
