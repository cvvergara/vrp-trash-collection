# OSRM back-end server for VRP

OSRM server is used for computing routes and travel times in some of our
vehicle routing problem solvers. This requires setting up a OSRM server and
preparing data for it. The goal of this document is to walk throught the
steps to get it built and run locally.

## Building OSRM

I use an older version of git at commit fbbd6ca because I'm (Steve) running Ubuntu
12.04 LTS but I think you can use up to tag v0.3.10.

https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Building-on-Ubuntu

Read the above link to install all the required dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend.git
cd osrm-backend
git checkout v0.3.10
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This will create and install:

 * osrm-extract - tool to read .osm and .pbf file to create OSRM input
 * osrm-prepare - tool to read OSRM input and create a graph file for the router
 * osrm-routed - the OSRM routing engine
 * osrm-datastore - tool for managing OSRM instances in memory


We (Steve?) will only work with the first three of these.

## Download data, extract and prepare it

You will need to download your area of interest that covers the area that you
plan to make routes in. Google is you friend:

  https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#newwindow=1&q=osm+pbf+download

Find an appropriate file and fetch it. We will use Uruguay for our example.

  http://download.geofabrik.de/south-america/uruguay.html

There are a bunch of support files that need to be present for OSRM to work a sample set is provided in the ``uruguay`` directory along with the scripts mentioned below. 

 * wget-latest-uruguay
 * do-prepare
 * run-test-server

If you need another country just remane the directory to the appropiate name, and change the scripts to handle the country you desire.

```
cd /path/for/osrm-data/
cp -r /path/to/vehicle-routing-problems-clone/tools/osrm-work/uruguay/ .
cd uruguay
sh ./wget-latest-uruguay
./do-prepare
./run-test-server
```

## Running the OSRM Server

As mentioned above there are some needed support files and if you have 
installed the ``osrm-work`` directory and prepared the data there then
all you need to do it run the ``run-test-server`` to get it running.

Having osrm-routed running is a requierment for vehicle-routing-problems programs to run, so if
 * you dont want it to start on boot up
 * if you want it to start on boot up and you couldn't solve the excersice.
then do the following every time you boot the computer.

```
cd /path/for/osrm-data/uruguay
./run-test-server
cd /path/to/where/you/were/before
```

If you want to stop the server then you can run:

```
sudo killall osrm-routed
```

If you change the data and want to restart the server then kill it and use the
``run-test-server`` again.

## Start OSRM at boot like other services

This process is a little more complicated. It requires installing these files

```
sudo cp etc/osrm.conf /etc/
sudo cp etc/init.d/osrm /etc/init.d/
```

You then need to edit ``/etc/osrm.conf`` and change the lines to point to the
appropriate files on your system. Then you can use:

```
sudo service osrm start|stop|reload|status
```

And to get it to run at boot time then run:

```
sudo update-rc.d osrm defaults
```

## Try it out

Lets get a route:

```
cd /path/to/any/direcotry/
GET 'http://localhost:5000/viaroute?z=18&instructions=true&alt=false&loc=-34.8977,-56.1241&loc=-34.8917,-56.1678'
```

You will get aan output that starts like:

```
{"status":0,"status_message": "Found route between point .....etc
```

If this does not work, then something is broken and you need to make sure all
the prior steps have run and completed successfully. If you can not get this 
to get some help.

## About server.ini

I have included a server.ini file which osrm-routed reads. I think it has been
deprecated in favor of commandline options. ``osrm-routed --help`` will
display them. For example it does not look like the router honors the Port
value in the server.ini file so it should eventually be removed and the
script updated to use the commandline options. If you are using the sysV init
scripts mentioned above, they do NOT support runing multiple instances of
``osrm-routed`` configured on different port. We would be happy to get a pull
request with improvements.
